(in my understanding,)

when you are training some cool AI with different strategies, how should you pick the right one? Well, with
**_model regression_** you can choose the best one and win df.

Regression is some magical thing no one understands. as explained by numerous images, underfitting is when the line doesn't go through that many points , overfitting is when the line goes through too many points, and just right is when it goes trough a modest amount of points
